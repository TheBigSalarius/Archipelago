# Rift Wizard (PC)

## Where is the settings page?

The [player settings page for this game](../player-settings) contains all the options you need to configure and export a
config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

Every regular "Mana Dot" item is replaced with an Archipelago item. 

## What items and locations get shuffled?

Up to 75 Mana Dots are shuffled into the item pool (Mana Dots can be replaced by Double Mana Dots in the settings to
make for an easier overall experience). 3 Mana Dot pickups per floor are replaced by Archipelago item locations and the 
number of total locations is reduced if the goal is based on reaching a specific floor.

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

When the player receives an item, you will see the SP (skill points) counter in the top left corner increment up by one
for a Mana Dot or two for a Double Mana Dot. The item received will also be displayed in the Rift Wizard Client.

## What happens if a player dies in a run?

If the player dies, they will be taken back to the main menu and will need to begin a new run from the beginning.
They will have access to all the SP from Mana Dots received by them up to that point in the multiworld.
Collecting a previously collected Archipelago item will not grant further checks.
Any consumable items found in an earlier run will not be retained.
